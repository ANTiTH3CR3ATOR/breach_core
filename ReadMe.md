### Breach: A Browser for the HTML5 Era

**Modular** 
Everything in the browser is a module, a web-app running in its own process.
Construct your own browsing experience by selecting the right modules for you.

**Hackable**
Want vertical tabs? Write some JS & CSS! Customised autocomplete engine? JS!
Every behavior is programmatic and exposed through APIs.

**OpenSource**
The entire technological stack is opensource.
Modify existing modules and create your owns to extend the behavior of Breach.
